## What is this?

swiftcars is a [Project Cars](http://www.projectcarsgame.com/) dash & telemetry app for iOS. It requires both [Project Cars](http://www.projectcarsgame.com/) and the [CREST REST API] (http://cars-rest-api.com/) to be configured correctly and running. 

Note: This software is under construction and far from stable.
